# Dogs breed app

Project info:
Because app simple with only 2 screens here, I'm provide share VM for this screen with single state
It's light vision of MVI pattern without Reducer, and clean architecture but without spliting to modules, and not
mapping some data entites to domain entites like status of response, don't needed here.
For network request retrofit + moshi with suspended functon.
I considered to use koin or kodein, but choosed dagger for DI.
Added some unit and ui tests.
Also description for task is kind a simple one, so I don't think additional what's going on in the app flow needed
